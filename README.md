# iOS Developer Portfolio  

## About  
Welcome to my iOS Developer Portfolio. This repository showcases my expertise in building high-quality iOS applications using Swift and SwiftUI. With a strong foundation in mobile app development, UI/UX design, and software architecture, I focus on creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications.  

## Projects  
This portfolio includes:  
- **Full-fledged iOS apps** demonstrating advanced architecture, state management, and animations.  
- **UI/UX mockups** that reflect modern design principles.  
- **Code samples** showcasing clean, maintainable, and scalable Swift/SwiftUI practices.  
- **Technical breakdowns** of app functionalities, including networking, data persistence, and performance optimizations.  

## Technologies & Tools  
- **Swift & SwiftUI** for modern app development.  
- **UIKit** for advanced UI components.  
- **Core Data & CloudKit** for efficient data handling.  
- **Combine & Async/Await** for reactive programming.  
- **RESTful APIs & GraphQL** integration.  

## Whatâ€™s Next?  
I'm continuously expanding this portfolio with new projects, code improvements, and deeper technical explorations of iOS development. Stay tuned for updates!
